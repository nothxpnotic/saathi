# SAATHI — Smart AI-Assisted Triage & Healthcare Interface

> **An offline-capable, AI-assisted OPD triage prototype for Pakistan's
> resource-limited public hospitals.**

---

## Overview

Pakistan's doctor-to-patient ratio of **1:1,300** — well below the
WHO-recommended 1:1,000 — means that most public OPDs process well over
1,200 patients daily with **no structured triage system**.  Life-threatening
presentations are routinely missed until it is too late.

**SAATHI** addresses this gap.  A paramedic enters four vital signs and a
chief complaint into a low-cost (~USD 90) Android tablet.  A locally
pre-trained **Gradient Boosted Classifier (GBC)** instantly assigns the
patient to one of three priority categories:

| Category | Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Immediate** | 🔴 Red | Critical — physician review NOW |
| **Urgent** | 🟠 Amber | High-priority — seen within 30 min |
| **Routine** | 🟢 Green | Standard queue |

The system runs **fully offline**, requires **no hospital IT
infrastructure**, and supports **English, Urdu, and regional languages**.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### Input Features

| Feature | Description | Range |
|---|---|---|
| `spo2` | Oxygen saturation (%) | 60 – 100 |
| `sbp` | Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) | 60 – 250 |
| `dbp` | Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) | 40 – 150 |
| `temperature` | Body temperature (°C) | 34 – 43 |
| `heart_rate` | Heart rate (bpm) | 30 – 220 |
| `complaint` | Chief complaint (integer code) | 0 – 9 |

### Model: `GradientBoostingClassifier`

```python
GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators   = 300,
    learning_rate  = 0.08,
    max_depth      = 4,
    subsample      = 0.8,
    max_features   = "sqrt",
    random_state   = 42,
)
```

### Expected Performance (Synthetic Dataset — for proof of concept only)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | ≥ 0.95 |
| Macro AUC (OvR) | ≥ 0.97 |
| Sensitivity – Immediate | ≥ 0.95 |
| Specificity – Immediate | ≥ 0.97 |

> ⚠ **These figures are from a synthetic dataset.**  Actual performance
> will be established during prospective clinical validation at district
> hospitals.  Sensitivity and specificity for the **Immediate** category
> are the primary clinical endpoints.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Clinical decision-support only.**  A qualified physician retains full
  responsibility for all patient management decisions.
- **Dataset bias.**  Early training phases with limited local data may
  under-represent certain demographic groups.  Iterative re-training on
  growing OPD datasets will be mandatory.
- **IRB approval** for patient data collection will be sought from the
  relevant institutional review boards before any clinical validation.
- **No patient data** is included in this repository.  The synthetic
  dataset is generated procedurally and contains no real patient records.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Prospective data collection at Nishtar Hospital, Multan (Phase 1)
- [ ] Local model re-training on anonymised OPD registers
- [ ] ONNX export and Android APK packaging
- [ ] Thermal printer integration (OPD slip)
- [ ] District hospital pilot (Phase 2 validation)
- [ ] National integration study under Pakistan UHC initiative
